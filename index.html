            <li>
                How do the origins of a leaf affect the weight the leaf can hold.  
            </li>

            <li>
                Hypothesis- If the type of leaf affects the leaf strength, then the green leaves will be stronger.
            </li>

            <li>
                Lignin and Cellulose are macromolecules found in cell walls of plant cells that strengthen the plant or leaf. These macromolecules help the leaf withstand powerful forces such as storms or strong wind. Turgidity is the pressure of water on the side of a container. If the leaf is from a different plant the strength could change.

                            After the dependant variable is decided collect 5 leaves of each type.

                            Observe leaves and record observations and differences.

                            Make RIP o’ Meter. (see diagram)

                    <li>
                            Put leaf on the RIP o’ Meter near the stem, and hold the leaf from the top of the stem.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                            Put pennies in the RIP o’ Meter until the leaf breaks from the weight.

                            Record your data and make a table or graph.

                </ol>
            </li>

            <l>
                Leaf One
                <ul>
                    <l>
                        round
                    </l>

                    <l>
                        soft texture
                    </l>

                    <l>
                        green
                    </l>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    Leaf Two
                    <l>
                        brown
                    </l>

                    <l>
                        crunchy texture
                    </l>

                    <l>
                        jagged
                    </l>
                </ul>
            </l>

            <l>
                    The average of Leaf One is 25, and the average of Leaf Two is 57.6, then that means that Leaf Two is stronger than Leaf One. The range for Leaf One is 13 and the range for Leaf Two is 53, so Leaf One had more accurate results.
            </l>

            <l>
                    The hypothesis was not supported because the prediction was that Leaf One was stronger, but Leaf Two was actually the stronger leaf. Leaf Two was stronger because it had a hard, crunchy and strong structure. Leaf One had a soft and wispy structure that was weaker than Leaf Two’s structure. For future experiments, the color, type or size of the leaf could be changed for a different outcome.
